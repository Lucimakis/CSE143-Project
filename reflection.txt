Throughout our project, we learned much about creating game characters and levels, as well as some of the differences between C# and Java. One of the best parts of the 
project was seeing the characters and levels come to life as we worked on them and the creative opportunities in programming the behavior of our characters and levels 
using scripts. However, one of the hardest parts was learning how to start the project and creating a way to detect collisions for the player to know when he is touching 
the ground. We ended up doing research via beginner guides and articles and took inspiration from games we had played before (namely spelunky). Working with and testing our scripts helped to show bugs that we had not even thought of before and contributed greatly to our learning. Overall, the project was a difficult start but we became more comfortable with adding features as we progressed.
